This report serves as a final summary of the [basic example](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/tree/master/inst/examples/basic). If your work does not require an R Markdown report, you can do away with this file entirely.

Our workflow originally began with two simulated datasets, `small` and `large`.

```{r example_chunk}
library(drake)
readd(small)
loadd(large)
head(large)
```

Then, we proceeded to analyze and summarize the datasets. One of the summaries is a set of regression coefficients we obtained from analyzing the `small` dataset.

```{r second_example_chunk}
readd(coef_regression2_small)
```

Because of the calls to `readd()` and `loadd()`, `drake` knows that `small`, `large`, and `coef_regression2_small` are dependencies of this R Markdown report. This dependency relationship is what causes the report to be processed at the very end.
