This example project analyzes the `mtcars` dataset to try to determine if there is an association between a car's weight and its fuel efficiency. Except for `interactive-tutorial.R`, the files here show how to set up a `drake` project. Run `make.R` to run or update the whole workflow, and read the output `report.md` file to see the results.
