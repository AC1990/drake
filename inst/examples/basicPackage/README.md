# basicPackage

`basicPackage` is `drake`'s basic example encapsulated in a [formal R package structure](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html). This approach is [one of many great ways to organize, distribute, maintain, and quality-control data science and research projects](https://github.com/ropensci/rrrpkg). See `vignettes/basicPackage.Rmd` for more details.
