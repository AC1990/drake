# Troubleshooting

The "caution" vignette (`vignette("caution")`, also linked from the [CRAN page](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=drake) under "vignettes") lists some known issues, limitations, and edge cases. Please look there first if you encounter problems or unexpected behavior. If that fails, please search the [issues page](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/issues), taking care to browse the closed issues as well. If you are still unsatisfied, please submit your bug report, question, or feature reqest as a [new issue](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/issues/new).
