Version 4.2.0 will be released today. There are several improvements to code style and performance. In addition, there are new features such as cache/hash externalization and runtime prediction. See the new storage and timing vignettes for details. This release has automated checks for back-compatibility with existing projects, and I also did manual back compatibility checks on serious projects.

Version 3.0.0 is coming out. It manages environments more intelligently so that the behavior of `make()` is more consistent with evaluating your code in an interactive session.
