\title{Function \code{backend}}
\usage{
backend(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{arguments to \code{future::plan()}.}
}
\value{
The same return value as \code{future::plan()}.
}
\description{
Select the specific \code{future}-style
parallel backend for \code{make(..., parallelism = "future_lapply")}.
For more information, please read the documentation,
tutorials, and vignettes of the R packages
\code{future} and \code{future.batchtools}.
}
\details{
The \code{backend()} function is exactly
the same as \code{future::plan()}.
We provide it only because \code{workplan()} conflicts
with \code{future::plan()}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
load_basic_example() # Load the canonical drake example.
# For future-based backends, you will need the "future" package,
# and for high-performance computing, maybe future.batchtools.
library(future)
backend(multicore) # Same as future::plan(multicore)
# Run the project with future-powered multicore parallelism.
# The number of jobs is automatic: however many would benefit.
# Set options(mc.cores = 2) to cap the number of jobs at 2.
make(my_plan, parallelism = "future_lapply")
clean() # Erase the targets to start from scratch.
backend(multisession) # Use separate background R sessions.
# This next make() is similar to "parLapply" parallelism.
make(my_plan, parallelism = "future_lapply")
clean() # Remove targets/imports from the cache, start from scratch.
library(future.batchtools) # More heavy-duty future-style parallel backends
# https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.batchtools#choosing-batchtools-backend # nolint
backend(batchtools_local) # Test out future.batchtools locally.
# Should proceed prety much like the multisession backend.
make(my_plan, parallelism = "future_lapply")
