`Drake` has powerful visuals to help you understand and plan your workflow.

```{r graphoutdated}
library(drake)
load_basic_example()
plot_graph(my_plan)
```

# Parallelism

When you call `make(my_plan, jobs = 8)`, the work proceeds in chronological order from left to right. The items are built or imported column by column in sequence, and up-to-date targets are skipped. Within each column, the targets/objects are all independent of each other conditional on the previous steps, so they are distributed over the 4 available parallel jobs/workers. Assuming the targets are rate-limiting (as opposed to imported objects), the next `make(..., jobs = 8)` should be faster than `make(..., jobs = 1)`, but it would be superfluous to use more than 8 jobs.

# Dependency reactivity

In the previous graph, all the targets were out of date.

```{r graphmake}
make(my_plan, jobs = 4)
plot_graph(my_plan)
```

But after a `make()`, we are all caught up.

When you change a dependency, you throw some targets out of date until you call `make(my_plan)` again.

```{r reg2graphvisual}
reg2 <- function(d){
  d$x3 <- d$x ^ 3
  lm(y ~ x3, data = d)
}
plot_graph(my_plan)
```

style="border: none; box-shadow: none">

# Subgraphs

Graphs can grow enormous for serious workflows, so there are multiple ways to focus on a subgraph. True, you can simply zoom into any of the graphs above using your mouse, but that is probably not enough. Use `targets_only` to ignore the imports.

```{r targetsonly}
plot_graph(my_plan, targets_only = TRUE)
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/b0169ed6/images/targetsonly.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">

Similarly, you can just show downstream nodes.

```{r fromout}
plot_graph(my_plan, from = c("regression2_small", "regression2_large"))
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/b0169ed6/images/fromout.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>


Or upstream ones.

```{r fromin}
plot_graph(my_plan, from = "small", mode = "in")
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/b0169ed6/images/fromin.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>

In fact, let's just take a small neighborhood around a target.


```{r fromall}
plot_graph(my_plan, from = "small", mode = "all", order = 1)
```

<iframe
src = "https://cdn.rawgit.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/b0169ed6/images/fromall.html"
width = "100%" height = "600px" allowtransparency="true"
style="border: none; box-shadow: none">
</iframe>

Remember, the `report.md` node is far to the right because it is in a later parallelizable stage. If you do not care about parallelizable stages, simply `shrink_edges`.

```{r shrink}
plot_graph(
  my_plan,
  from = "small",
  mode = "all",
  order = 1,
  shrink_edges = TRUE
)
```
