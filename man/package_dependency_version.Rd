\description{
Packages are formally imported into drake workflows,
and they serve as dependencies of package functions.
Specifically, the version of each package is tracked.
For base packages like \code{base} and \code{stats},
the version of R itself is tracked. Here, the version string
is used, so different snapshots of R-devel have different versions.
