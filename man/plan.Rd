\title{Deprecated function \code{plan}}
\usage{
plan(..., list = character(0), file_targets = FALSE,
  strings_in_dots = c("filenames", "literals"))
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{commands named by the targets they generate.
Recall that drake uses single quotes to denote external files
and double-quoted strings as ordinary strings.
Use the \code{strings_in_dots} argument to control the
quoting in \code{...}.}

\item{list}{character vector of commands named
by the targets they generate.}

\item{file_targets}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, targets are single-quoted
to tell drake that these are external files that should be expected
as output in the next call to \code{\link{make}()}.}

\item{strings_in_dots}{character scalar. If \code{"filenames"},
all character strings in \code{...} will be treated as names of file
dependencies (single-quoted). If \code{"literals"}, all
character strings in \code{...} will be treated as ordinary
strings, not dependencies of any sort (double-quoted).
Because of R's automatic parsing/deparsing behavior,
strings in \code{...} cannot simply be left alone.}
}
\value{
A data frame of targets and commands.
}
\description{
Turns a named collection of command/target pairs into
a workflow plan data frame for \code{\link{make}} and
\code{\link{check}}. Deprecated in favor of
\code{\link{workplan}()} due to a name conflict with
\code{future::plan()}.
