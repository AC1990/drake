Drake is a workflow manager for R. When it runs a project, it automatically builds missing and outdated results while skipping over all the up-to-date output. This automation and reproducibility is important for data analysis workflows, especially large projects under heavy development.

# Acknowledgements and history

The original idea of a time-saving reproducible build system extends back decades to [GNU Make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/), which today helps [data scientists](http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/15/make-for-data-scientists/) as well as the original user base of complied-language programmers. More recently, [Rich FitzJohn](http://richfitz.github.io/) created [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake), a breakthrough reimagining of [Make](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/) for R and the most important inspiration for drake. Drake is a fresh, minimalist reinterpretation of some of  [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake)'s pioneering fundamental concepts, scaled up for computationally-demanding workflows. Relative to [remake](https://github.com/richfitz/remake), some of drake's most prominent distinguishing features at the time of writing this document are

- a more convenient, R-focused, [YAML](http://yaml.org/)-free user interface.
- smoother user-side handling of external files and nested commands.
- **seamless** integration with [Makefiles](http://kbroman.org/minimal_make/) for built-in high-performance computing.

Thanks also to [Kirill M&uuml;ller](http://krlmlr.github.io/) and [Daniel Falster](http://danielfalster.com/). They contributed code patches and enhancement ideas to my [parallelRemake](https://github.com/wlandau/parallelRemake) and [remakeGenerator](https://github.com/wlandau/remakeGenerator) packages, which I have now subsumed into drake.

# Rtools for Windows users

Windows users need [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to run `make(..., makefile = TRUE)` (`system2("make")` needs to be possible).

# Help and troubleshooting

Use the `help_drake()` function to obtain a collection of helpful links. For troubleshooting, please refer to [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/blob/master/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake) for instructions.


# Quickstart examples

Drake has small self-contained built-in examples. To see the names of the available examples, use

```{r}
examples_drake()
```

Then use `example_drake()` to write the files for the example to your working directory.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
example_drake("basic")
```

Step through the code files to get started.
