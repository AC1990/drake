- generators: code changed: do aggressive tests of all functions & args & opts
  - plan(): all arguments used as expected
  - analyses, summaries, gather (rbind, NULL), expand
- cache functions
  - cached()
  - built()
  - imported()
  - readd: character_only, path, search
  - loadd: ..., list() (and quoting in lots of ways), imported_only, path, search
  - get_cache, find_project, session(): path, search
  - clean: destroy = TRUE, FALSE. check that uncache removes target from all relevant namespaces (objects, depends, maybe more. check all the namespaces i have, including with makefiles).
  - prune, just in debug plan. then check if intermediate file is removed too.
- on my own
  - same build tests for differnet jobs, parallelisms, file sizes (for rehashing), and platforms
  - included example(s) in inst/ (basic)
  - jady: be sure to test packages/prework
  - rehashing speeds for larger files
