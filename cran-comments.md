# Version 2.0.0

This version is not back-compatible with version 1.0.1.
I still tried my best to deprecate the user-level functions, but because
of all the internal updates, existing workflows will need to rerun
from scratch due to the upgrade.


# Version 1.0.1

This version is the first submission to CRAN.
